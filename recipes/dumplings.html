        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Nepalese version of the Asian dumpling. It is filled with ground pork and 
            Asian spices and steamed</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ground pork</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>chili powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pork, onion, cilantro, red pepper flakes, red curry paste, 
                garam masala, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. 
                Mix well, then set aside. Place flour into a separate bowl. Slowly stir 
                in the water as needed until a soft dough is achieved. There may be some 
                water left over. Roll out walnut-sized balls of dough into thin circles.</li>
            <li>Fill each of the wrappers with about 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture. 
                Moisten the edges of the wrapper, then fold in half, sealing to create 
                a half moon shape. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling. Place
                 the dumplings in a steamer over 1 inch of boiling water, and cover. 
                 Steam until the dough becomes glossy, about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>To make sauce: Combine peanut butter, cayenne pepper, sugar, and vegetable
                 oil in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl. Cook in the microwave on High 
                 for 30 seconds and stir. Serve with the dumplings.</li>
